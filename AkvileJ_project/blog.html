                <h4>Psychopsis Mariposa Peloric care</h4>
                <p>
                    Commonly nick-named the 'Giraffe Orchid', or Mariposa orchid
                    (butterfly) Psychopsis are fantastic orchids that produce
                    flowers one after another on the same spike for 10-15 years.
                    Never cut the flower spikes even if you should accidentally
                    break one as they can branch below the break and continue to
                    flower. The flowers last about three weeks before falling
                    off and within another three weeks or so, another bud forms
                    and repeats the process. Water as the potting mix approaches
                    dryness or just dries out. Grow as you would for a
                    Phalaenopsis. this is particular variety is the peloric form
                    in which the petals have taken up the shape and size of the
                    lip. This easy to grow and flower plant will provide years
                    of enjoyment. Use clean water low in mineral content for
                    best results. Do not use softened water as it contains salt.

                <p>
                    A higher elevation Madagascar species from a cloud forest
                    environment that has a pendulous growth habit, and shiny,
                    smooth leaves. The non-resupinate flowers have beautiful
                    spidery petals offset neatly by the round somewhat large
                    disc shaped lip. The flowers have an excellent fragrance at
                    night. These plants do best at cool to intermediate temps
                    and once they start flowering many spikes can be produced
                    over a period of several months. Very easy to grow and
                    flower!

                <p>
                    Perhaps one of the most beautiful of the Coelogyne with
                    white flowers and a chocolate-red lip. Fragrant. From the
                    Philippines. Described recently in 2001. Up to 20-inch
                    flower spikes with 10 to 20 flowers. This blooms off and on
                    throughout the year. The flower spikes arch and hang
                    downwards and produce a number of flowers over several weeks
                    one at a time. It is not unusual for the older leaves to be
                    dying back as the newest growths flower.
