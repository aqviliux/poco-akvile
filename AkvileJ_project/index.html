                I am AkvilÄ—. I am from Lithuania. I and my family are here for
                five years. We really love Switzerland. I studied in Vilnius
                University in Mathematics Informatics faculty and got an
                Actuarial Mathematics bachelor diploma. After my studies I
                worked in a bank for five years. I was using a lot of MS Access
                in my daily tasks. So I improved my knownledges in MS SQL and
                got a job as a database developer. I worked in an international
                company and my colleagues were very impressed by my fast
                learning, attention to the details. These two years were very
                productive and interesting. Also I got married at this time and
                decided to have a child. After few years we as a family decided
                to come to Switzerland and check - is it as nice as we hear ;)

            <p>
                Lithuania is a small country near Baltic sea. My country has had
                quite difficult times in the past so I am really happy that we
                as a nation can be proud of our achievements now.
