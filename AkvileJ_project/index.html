        <p>I am Akvilė. I am from Lithuania. I and my family are here about five years. We really love
            Switzerland. I studied in Vilnius University in Mathematics Informatics faculty. After my studies I worked in a bank for
            five years. I was using a lot of MS Accsess in my daily tasks. So I improved my knownledges in MS SQL and got a job as database developer. 
            I worked in the international company and my colleagues were very impressed by my fast learning, attention to the details. 
            These two years were very productive and interesting.
            Also I got married at this time and decided to have a child. After few years we as a family
            decided to come to Switzerland and check - is it as nice as we hear ;) </p>
